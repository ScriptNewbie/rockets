Basically a site that takes data from [rocketlaunch.live's API](https://www.rocketlaunch.live/api) and displays it. 

I started this project to learn some Next.JS and Tailwind CSS.

~When finished will be deployed somewhere... (if finished, right now only few things are implemented)~

Certainly not finished, but deployed anyway on [rockets.zttw.it](https://rockets.zttw.it)
